# Australian Federal Voting Application

The following is an application I created using PHP and Oracle in between July and November 2023. It is designed to allow Australians to vote online, and takes in data from their electorate, election to assist them with voting. I leveraged Oracle as a way to optimise for storing a large amount of data, and used database functions to contain complex logic, like vote counting and ballot issuing. The PHP frontend is desined as a simple GUI for the user to interact with.
